## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Hover/focus
- CSS Layer

### What I learned

I was looking forward to use layer in native CSS as I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for it. Since it a rather small project, I used only for:

- reset
- body(with wrapper)
- root

### Continued development

How to work with CSS nesting and layer more
